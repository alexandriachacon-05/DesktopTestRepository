Brief Description of Goal of Code: The goal of this code is to present a working website that acts as a sort of diagnostic device to use four questions in order to diagnose whether a person is experiencing allergies or the presence of a cold. This website uses buttons to calculate a probability of allergies vs. a cold.

Known Issues: As of this moment, there appears to be no known issues in the code. It appears to be up and running successfully.
